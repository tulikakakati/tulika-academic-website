#Hello!
---
I  am a PhD from Tezpur University, India and my research interests are on finding disease biomarkers from biological data using machine learning techniques.  The following are a brief overview of my proposed research.

1. Use deep learning models to predict disease biomarkers – gene, pathway, and miRNA biomarkers – and generalize to unseen data instances in real time.
2.  To predict various miRNA-disease associations, such as miRNA-target, circulations, epigenetics, and genetics, using both microarray and sequencing expression data.
3.  Utilize the labeled esophagus cancer datasets to train a neural network and use the trained model to predict esophagus cancer instances in Assam, India, where a labeled esophagus cancer dataset is not yet profiled.
4.  Use deep leaning models on DNA/RNA sequences to find the biological pathway variations that lead to the occurrence of a disease.

#Hope you like my profile.
